#School project - Inventory Management System

_NOTE_: This is stuff from 4 years ago, done in BlueJ. 

The code can very well be horrible, but please forgive me as this as my first real project.
There's also a lot of wheel-reinventing going on here that I would not do today.

I tried to make it as user-friendly a CLI as I could, and I took it out of its archive to clean it up before I published this.
